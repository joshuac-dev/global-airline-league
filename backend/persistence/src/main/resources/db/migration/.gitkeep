# Placeholder for Flyway migrations

This directory will contain SQL migration scripts in the format:
- V1__initial_schema.sql
- V2__add_airports_table.sql
- etc.

Flyway will automatically discover and apply migrations in version order.

For now, this directory is empty as the initial PR focuses on scaffolding.
